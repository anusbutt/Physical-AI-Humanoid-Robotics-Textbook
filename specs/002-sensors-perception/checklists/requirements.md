# Specification Quality Checklist: Module 2 - Sensors and Perception for Humanoid Robots

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-06
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

All checklist items pass. Specification is complete and ready for `/sp.plan`.

**Validation Results**:
- 4 user stories covering all lesson topics (cameras, depth sensors, IMU, sensor fusion)
- 13 functional requirements covering content structure, technical depth, and deliverables
- 8 success criteria with measurable outcomes (time, percentage, confidence ratings)
- Comprehensive assumptions section documenting prerequisites and technical context
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - all requirements are clear and testable
- Success criteria are technology-agnostic and measurable
- Edge cases identified for sensor failures, environmental challenges, and data conflicts
