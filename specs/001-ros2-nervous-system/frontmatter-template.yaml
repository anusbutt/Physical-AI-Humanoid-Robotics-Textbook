    #   - "Read and interpret Python rclpy code for simple nodes"

    proficiency_level: "[beginner | intermediate | advanced]"
    # Use "beginner" for Module 1

    bloom_level: "[remember | understand | apply | analyze | evaluate | create]"
    # Should match the verb in the objective
    # "Understand" → "understand"
    # "Explain/Identify" → "understand"
    # "Apply/Use" → "apply"

    assessment_method: "[How this objective is measured]"
    # Examples:
    #   - "quiz + capstone project"
    #   - "quiz questions 1-4"
    #   - "capstone design exercise"
    #   - "practice exercise + self-reflection"

  # - objective: "[Second objective]"
  #   proficiency_level: "beginner"
  #   bloom_level: "understand"
  #   assessment_method: "quiz"

# FIELD 5: Cognitive Load (Object with 2 sub-fields)
# Assessment of how demanding this lesson is for students
cognitive_load:
  new_concepts: [3-7]
  # Integer count of NEW concepts introduced (not reinforced from prior lessons)
  # Range: 3-7 concepts per lesson (spec requirement)
  # Examples:
  #   - Lesson 1: 5 (ROS2, middleware, nodes, topics, pub/sub)
  #   - Lesson 2: 4 (services, request/response, QoS, communication patterns)

  assessment: "[Difficulty description]"
  # String describing cognitive demand and prerequisites
  # Format: "[low/moderate/high] - [reason/context]"
  # Examples:
  #   - "moderate - builds on networking and Python knowledge"
  #   - "moderate - introduces new concepts but leverages prior ROS2 understanding"
  #   - "low - reinforces concepts from previous lessons"

# FIELD 6: Differentiation (Object with 2 sub-fields)
# Guidance for students at different learning levels/paces
differentiation:
  extension_for_advanced: "[Optional deeper exploration for fast/advanced students]"
