Through specialized GPU-accelerated libraries called GEMs (GPU-accelerated modules), Isaac ROS dramatically improves the performance of computationally intensive perception tasks like Visual SLAM, object detection, and pose estimation. For humanoid robots that require rapid processing of sensor data to maintain balance and navigate safely, Isaac ROS provides the performance necessary for real-time operation.","permalink":"/hackathon-phase-01/docs/Physical-AI-Humanoid-Robotics/isaac-ai-brain/isaac-ros-perception"}],"unlisted":false}}')}}]);
