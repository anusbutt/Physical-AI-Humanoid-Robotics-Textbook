# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics learning path! This chapter explores the fundamental technologies powering humanoid robots and physical AI systems.

## What You'll Learn

This chapter covers the complete technology stack for building intelligent humanoid robots, from low-level robot control systems to high-level AI reasoning. You'll gain conceptual understanding of each layer and how they integrate to create autonomous humanoid robots.

## Modules

### Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

**Focus**: Middleware for robot control

Learn how ROS 2 serves as the "nervous system" for humanoid robots, coordinating communication between sensors, actuators, and control systems. This foundational module covers:

- ROS 2 fundamentals and architecture
- Node communication patterns (topics, services)
- Python integration with rclpy
- Robot description with URDF

### Module 2: Sensors and Perception for Humanoid Robots

**Focus**: How humanoid robots sense and understand their environment

Learn how humanoid robots perceive the world through cameras, depth sensors, and IMUs. This module covers:

- Camera systems and computer vision basics
- Depth sensing technologies (LiDAR, structured light, ToF)
- IMU and proprioception for balance and orientation
- Sensor fusion techniques to combine multiple sensor inputs
