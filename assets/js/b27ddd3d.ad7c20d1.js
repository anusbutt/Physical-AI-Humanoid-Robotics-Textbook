This integration creates a complete pipeline from simulation and training through real-time perception and navigation, enabling humanoid robots to operate autonomously in complex environments. Understanding how these components connect and exchange information is essential for designing effective autonomous systems.","permalink":"/hackathon-phase-01/docs/Physical-AI-Humanoid-Robotics/isaac-ai-brain/integration-autonomous-navigation"}],"unlisted":false}}')}}]);
