For humanoid robots, Nav2 requires specialized configurations and extensions to accommodate the unique constraints of bipedal locomotion, including footstep planning, center-of-mass stability, and gait-specific movement patterns. Unlike wheeled robots that can move continuously in any direction, humanoid robots must plan discrete foot placements while maintaining balance throughout the navigation process.","permalink":"/hackathon-phase-01/docs/Physical-AI-Humanoid-Robotics/isaac-ai-brain/nav2-path-planning"}],"unlisted":false}}')}}]);
